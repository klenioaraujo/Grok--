# GROK-Ω (OMEGA) - Enhanced Architecture

## Pure Physics. No Softmax. No Tokenization. No Shame.

### CORE CONCEPT: CONTINUOUS THOUGHT WAVE

No discrete tokens.
Language = continuous wave in semantic phase space
→ ψ(x,t) ∈ ℂ⁴ (quaternionic field)

Input: Sentence as wave field
Output: Next wave → decoded into language via interference

### ENHANCED ARCHITECTURE: ADVANCED PHYSICAL PIPELINE

**Physical Coherent Pipeline:**
Tokens → Embeddings → Quaternions → Unitary Evolution → FFT → Spectral Attention → Multi-head Interference → Logits

#### TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS
✅ **Multi-head Interference**: Replaces traditional attention with quantum interference across specialized heads
✅ **Spectral Attention with FFT**: Operates in frequency domain for capturing sequence patterns
✅ **Residual Connections**: Stabilizes training through skip connections
✅ **Layer Normalization**: Professional normalization for stable gradients

### PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Padilha Equation**: f(λ,t) = I₀ sin(ωt + αλ) e^(i(ωt - kλ + βλ²))
2. **Quaternionic Fields**: ψ ∈ ℍ (quaternion field)
3. **Unitary Evolution**: iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = H ψ
4. **Spectral Attention**: FFT-based attention in frequency domain
5. **Multi-head Interference**: Parallel quantum interference heads
6. **ZERO FALLBACK POLICY**: Physical failure is honest failure

### INSTALLATION AND USAGE

```bash
cd Grok-Ω
python3 grok_omega.py
```

### EXPECTED OUTPUT

### DETAILED ENHANCED ARCHITECTURE

#### 1. Token Embedding + Layer Normalization
- Standard token embeddings with positional encoding
- Layer normalization after embedding for stable gradients

#### 2. Quaternionic Projection + Normalization
- Projects embeddings to 4-component quaternionic field
- Layer normalization after quaternionic transformation

#### 3. Unitary Evolution Layer
- Temporal evolution via learnable complex Hamiltonian
- Matrix exponential for unitary evolution
- Preserves quantum norm and unitarity

#### 4. Residual Connection
- Skip connection from embedding to post-evolution
- Stabilizes training gradients

#### 5. Spectral Attention via FFT
- FFT transforms sequence to frequency domain
- Attention operates on spectral magnitudes
- Captures frequency patterns in sequences

#### 6. Multi-head Interference
- Parallel heads with independent spectral attention
- Each head specializes in different frequency bands
- Interference-based weighting (no softmax)
- Aggregated logits across heads

#### 7. ZERO FALLBACK POLICY
- Physical failure is honest failure
- No fallback mechanisms or approximations

### TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS IN DETAIL

#### Spectral Attention via FFT
```python
evolved_fft = torch.fft.fft(evolved, dim=1)
spectral_attn = torch.abs(evolved_fft)  # Frequency domain attention!
```
✅ **Attention in spectral domain** (not temporal)
✅ **Captures frequency patterns** in sequences

#### Multi-head Interference
```python
# Each head projects independently
logits_heads = []
for h in range(self.num_heads):
    # Spectral attention per head
    weights_h = attn_h / (attn_h.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True) + 1e-8)
```
✅ **Parallelism like transformers**
✅ **Spectral specialization** per head
